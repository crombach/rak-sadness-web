# Rak Madness Calculator

Simple auto-scoring web application for [Rak Madness](https://rakmadness.net/). The [public site](https://rak.cullenrombach.com/) is hosted on [CloudFlare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/).

Results are viewable on the web and can be exported to an XLSX spreadsheet.

Uses [the hidden ESPN API](https://gist.github.com/akeaswaran/b48b02f1c94f873c6655e7129910fc3b) to fetch game results, and consumes the weekly Rak Madness spreadsheet to do auto-scoring.
Spreadsheets provided by Rak may require some cleanup before they can be parsed, though an effort has been made to standardize on the ESPN team abbreviations.

Here is a [spreadsheet for team abbreviations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPdaaXTtnA33izapArCRN--BTNYb-Q0GwhhycJ4dx3w/edit?usp=drivesdk) in both the NFL and NCAA.
Here is a link to [the Google Drive folder containing historical picks and scores spreadsheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oHVWKoAbDtT2vJLU3yBP9ofEOPEzNrqi?usp=sharing).

This was thrown together using KISS principles for a small, family-and-friends football pool. It is not intended for public (or at-scale) use and, as such, should not be judged too harshly.

## Development

Built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/), React 19, TypeScript, [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/), and [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/). Base UI ships unstyled primitives, so the look lives in SCSS with design tokens in `src/index.scss`.

The home page is `/`. A week's results live at `/week/:week/scoreboard` and `/week/:week/picks`, so they can be linked and reloaded. Picks come from `/api/picks/:week` first, then from a per-week cache of anything uploaded in that browser. A week with no picks either way sends you home with an explanation. Requires Node `v22` (`.nvmrc`). Run `nvm use` first.

```
make setup   # install dependencies from the lockfile
make run     # dev server on http://localhost:3000 (make run PORT=3001 to move it)
make build   # production build into ./build
make test    # Vitest, once, no watch mode
make check   # lint, typecheck, test, prettier
make format  # eslint --fix, then prettier
```

`make help` lists every target.

`npm run pages:dev` builds first, then serves `./build` through wrangler on port 3000. Use it to exercise the Cloudflare side; use `make run` for hot reload. The `/api/picks/:week` route is a Pages Function reading `picks/<week>.xlsx` from the `RAK_SADNESS_BUCKET` binding declared in `wrangler.toml`. Locally that bucket is simulated and starts empty, so the route returns 404 and the app falls back to manual spreadsheet upload. Seed it with:

```
npx wrangler r2 object put rak-sadness/picks/1.xlsx --file <path> --local
```

## Deploying

Cloudflare Pages builds from git on its own, using the build settings in the
Cloudflare dashboard. Push to `main` for production, push any other branch for a
preview. wrangler is here for local testing only, so there is deliberately no
deploy script to run.
