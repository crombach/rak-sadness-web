# table

- `TableShell`: the frame both results tables share, the filler rows carrying a
  table to the bottom of the viewport, and the trailing row keeping the last real
  row clear of a phone's rounded corners. Takes `caption`, `ariaBusy`, `ariaHidden`,
  `standInRows`.
- `Table.scss`: the shared `.table` styles, sticky header and player column, touch
  feedback, striped rows, the trailing row, the `.table__cell-button` a clickable
  cell holds, and the width a column of each kind is laid out at. Fixed, so a long
  value is cut short rather than widening it.
- `SkeletonTable`: the wireframe shown while a week is worked out. Its columns are
  the real ones' width, and its sixty-odd rows scroll as the table will.
