 * Where a player stands, in one icon. Shared by the tables' name cells and the
 * player analysis search, so the same player is marked the same way in both.
 *
 * Still standing at the end of the week is what winning the week is.
 *
 * Drawn as outlines, against the filled icons the rest of the app uses. A row is
 * a line of text with one of these at the end of it, and a filled shape at that
 * size reads as a blot rather than as a face, a trophy, or a skull.
