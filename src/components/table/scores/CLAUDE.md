# scores

`ScoresTable`: memoized ranked results table. Renders nothing without scores.
Columns: rank, `PlayerName` cell, MNF pick and distance, college/pro/ATS/total scores.
Its `TableShell` caption, "Player rankings for the week, by total score", is the
table's own accessible name; visually hidden, since the page around it already
says what week this is.
