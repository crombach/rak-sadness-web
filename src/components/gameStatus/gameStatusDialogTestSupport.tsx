/**
 * Shared by `GameStatusDialog.test.tsx` and `GameStatusDialogOnGameFinal.test.tsx`,
 * which mock the same fetch and open the dialog the same way but cannot share a file:
 * Base UI leaves scroll-lock and focus guards behind a mounted dialog, which puts a
 * second dialog's own search out of reach.
 *
 * Each importer must still call `vi.mock("../../utils/getLeagueResults")` itself:
 * that hoists above the importer's own top-level imports, which is what keeps
 * `GameStatusDialog`'s real fetch from loading before the mock is in place. A
 * `vi.mock` call here would only hoist within this file.
