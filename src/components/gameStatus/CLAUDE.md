# gameStatus

How a game in the week is going, opened from a pick cell.

- `GameStatusDialog`: `DialogShell` over a `DialogCombobox` of `scores.games`, in picks
  table column order, which the query matches. `GameMark` says where a game stands;
  `useLiveGame` keeps the chosen one fresh.
- `GameStatusSummary`: the pool's line, the game as ESPN's boxscore says it, its kickoff,
  town and Gamecast link. The wireframe is that layout over the week's own copy, held
  until both marks decode too, so neither pops in over it. `useScorelineFit`
  takes the full names, then the marks, off one too narrow.
- `GameStatusSummary.scss`: both sides in one grid, the dash in a track between two
  equal ones, so neither side moves it. `--rak-score-size` sizes that row.
