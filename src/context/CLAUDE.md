# context

- `AppDataContext`: the season list, week list, picks, and scores, held above the
  routes, with the season and week derived from the pathname. Publishes
  `WeekDecidedContext` and `ScoreChangesContext` separately, the latter what a
  refresh just changed, for the tables to flash.
- `ToastContext`: the toast list, split from its actions.
- `PlayerAnalysisContext`: how a player's name in a table opens the player analysis
  on them. One callback, a no-op with no provider above.
- `GameStatusContext`: the same, for a pick cell opening the game status on the
  column it sits in.
