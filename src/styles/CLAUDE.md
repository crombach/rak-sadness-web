# styles

Sass partials, mixins and variables only, so a partial emits no CSS however many
files `@use` it. `_skeleton.scss` is the one exception, and says so: it holds
keyframes. Design tokens live in `src/index.scss` instead.

- `_breakpoints.scss`: `roomy-screen`, `labelled-navbar`, `wide-screen`,
  `can-hover`, `phone-landscape`, `reduced-motion`
- `_focus.scss`: `focus-ring`, the app's one focus ring
- `_ink.scss`: `ink-height`, an icon drawn as tall as the text beside it
- `_a11y.scss`: `visually-hidden`
- `_label.scss`: `micro-label`, the tracked capitals every small label is set in
- `_lcd.scss`: `lcd-glass`, the readout the scoreline and the navbar name share,
  and `lcd-field`, the same well for a control typed or chosen into instead
- `_listbox.scss`: `listbox-popup` and `listbox-item`, a Base UI popup list's shape
- `_skeleton.scss`: `skeleton-surface`, `skeleton-sheen`, `skeleton-reserve`
