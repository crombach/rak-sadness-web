 * `season` is the year the week's season started in. It names the picks in the
 * API path and the cache, and it is what the games are scored against, so a week
 * played in January still scores against the season it belongs to. Nothing is
 * attempted until it is known.
 *
 * `attemptedFor` names the season and week this hook has finished trying, which
 * is not always the pair asked for: switching either leaves the old scores in
 * place until the new ones arrive. Anything reacting to a missing score has to
 * wait for it to catch up, or it will act on the previous week's outcome. The
 * season belongs there as much as the week, since week 5 exists in every season.
