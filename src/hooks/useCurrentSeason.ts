/**
 * The season running now, by the year it started in, once it has begun.
 *
 * Asked for on its own, because the season list holds only the seasons with picks
 * in the database, and the picker has to offer this one once it starts whether or
 * not it has any. A week of it with no picks behind it is scored from a spreadsheet
 * the user uploads, which is what that path is for.
 *
 * ESPN moves on to the next season as soon as the last one ends, months before
 * anything is played. That season has no week anybody could score, so it is left
 * undefined until its opener, as is a season ESPN could not be asked about at all.
 * The picker then offers the seasons it does know about and nothing else.
