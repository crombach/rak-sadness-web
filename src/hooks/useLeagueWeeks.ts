/**
 * The season's weeks, from the ESPN calendar, plus which one is selected.
 *
 * `selectableWeeks` holds the very objects the calendar returned. The week picker
 * compares its options by reference, so copying or rebuilding a `WeekInfo`
 * anywhere downstream leaves the picker unable to show a selection.
 *
 * `initialWeek` wins over the season's active week when the season has such a
 * week. A results URL names the week it wants, and without this the current week
 * would be selected and scored first, only to be replaced. It is read when the
 * calendar lands, so it can change without costing another lookup.
 *
 * `season` is the year a season started in. Left out, ESPN answers with the
 * season running now, and `seasonYear` comes back saying which one that was. A
 * season that has ended has every week behind it, so all of them are selectable.
 *
 * `enabled` holds the lookup back until the caller knows which season to ask for.
 * Without it the season running now would be fetched first and shown for a moment,
 * which is the wrong season whenever the pool is between seasons.
