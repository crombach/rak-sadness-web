# picks

Two GET routes under `/api/picks`, both reading the `RAK_MADNESS_BUCKET` R2
binding. The bracketed file names are Pages placeholders, part of the path.

- `index.ts`: the seasons that have picks, newest first, listed off the bucket
  rather than written down, so a new season appears with its first upload
- `[year]/[week].ts`: one week's xlsx as a download, ETag revalidated, because a
  corrected sheet keeps the URL the browser already cached
- `env.ts`: the `Env` binding type and the shared 503 helper
