"""PreToolUse hook: point Claude at the repo's build-run-test skill.

Pairs with the agentify-build skill. The skill holds what a Makefile target name
cannot carry — toolchain versions, ports, prereqs, offline-test handling — and a
skill only loads when the model picks it. This hook makes that pick deterministic:
before the first build-shaped Bash command of a session it injects one line naming
the skill.

Never blocks. The command runs either way; the hook only adds context.

Fires once per session, keyed on session_id, so a build-fix loop costs one
reminder. Silent when the skill is absent, when the command is not build-shaped,
and on any error.
